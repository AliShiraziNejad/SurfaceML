# Welcome! 
**SurfaceML** is developed as a solution to my friends asking me how deep learning works. 

The entire purpose of this is **to look at the source code of the models** and better understand how 
popular frameworks such as Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow work under the hood.

Currently IS supported:
- Sequential computational graphs
- All standard loss functions
- All standard activation functions
- Fully-Connected layers
- 1D layers

Currently NOT supported:
- GPU / hardware-acceleration
- Preprocessing
- Non-Sequential computational graphs
- Anything above 2D Conv-ish complexity
- Autograd / Autodiff / Algorithmic differentiation
