# Welcome! 
**SurfaceML** is developed as a response to my friends asking me how deep learning works. 

The entire purpose of this is **to look at the source code of the models** and better understand how 
popular frameworks such as Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow work under the hood.

The "**simple**" API is a replica of Tensorflow Keras API

The "**raw**" directory contains scripts that house everything needed to make a Neural Network

Currently NOT supported:
- GPU / hardware-acceleration
- Preprocessing
- Autograd / Autodiff 
- non-CNN/linear layers
